# Employee Management System (EMS)

Welcome to the **Employee Management System (EMS)**! üéâ

This is a **Spring Boot** powered application that allows you to manage employees, departments, and the relationships between them in a simple, yet effective way. From adding and updating employees to transferring them between departments, this project demonstrates the core functionality needed in an **Employee Management System** using **JPA**, **MySQL**, and **Spring Data**.

### üöÄ **Features**:

- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and delete employee records.
- **Department Management**: Create, update, and manage department records.
- **Employee-Department Relationship**: Assign employees to multiple departments and transfer them seamlessly with **Many-to-Many** relationship.
- **Advanced Queries**: Fetch employees by salary, joining date, department count, and more.
- **Pagination & Sorting**: Retrieve employees in batches, with sorting options.
- **Bulk Salary Updates**: Increase all employees' salaries in bulk.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensure atomic operations when transferring employees between departments.
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity with annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, and `@Positive`.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**:

- **Spring Boot**: The heart of the application, managing the overall structure and API endpoints.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For ORM-based interaction with the database.
- **MySQL**: A relational database used for persistent storage.
- **Swagger UI**: Interactive API documentation to explore endpoints and test them directly in your browser.
- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code for getters, setters, constructors, etc.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Efficient data access and management using repository patterns.
- **Maven**: For building and managing dependencies.

### üì¶ **Getting Started**:

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-system.git
    cd employee-management-system
    ```

2. **Setup MySQL Database**:
   - Make sure you have MySQL installed and running.
   - Create a database (e.g., `ems_db`):
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE ems_db;
     ```
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL connection details:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ems_db
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     ```

3. **Build the project** using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Access Swagger UI**:  
   Once the application is running, navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

# How it Works:

This project provides a solid foundation for managing employees and departments, with the flexibility of adding advanced features like salary updates, department transfers, and querying employee data with filters.

- **Entities** are defined using JPA, and relationships are set up using **Many-to-Many** (Employee ‚Üî Department).
- **Endpoints** are exposed for CRUD operations on employees and departments, as well as relationship operations for managing employee assignments to departments.
- **Validation** ensures that invalid data can't be added to the system (e.g., non-positive salary, invalid email).
- **Pagination** makes it easy to retrieve a large number of employees in manageable chunks.
- **Transaction Management** ensures operations like employee transfers are atomic, maintaining consistency in the data.

# Custom Queries and Bulk Operations:

- **Native Query for Top 3 Highest Paid Employees**: A custom native SQL query fetches the highest-paid employees in the company.
- **Bulk Salary Update**: An operation allows updating all employees' salaries by a specified percentage, demonstrating efficient batch updates using custom repository methods.
